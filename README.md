## Introduction
This is a connect-4 inspired game built with python and pygame for our **CSC 290: Communication Skills for Computer Scientists**. Our team members include:

- Niral Patel
- Tomasz Cieslak
- Michael Carmine De Lisio
- Ravnit Singh Lotay
- Michael Skotar

## Installation
Our game relies on both python and pygame. Python is the programming language that our game was coded in, while pygame is the package we used to have a graphical user interface.

### Downloading Python
#### Windows
To install python on windows please go to the python for windows installation provided [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### MacOS
To install python on mac, you can use the homebrew to install the python package. To do so run the following command: 

`brew install python3`

#### Linux
For linux distributions, such as Debian and Ubuntu use the package manager system that comes with the system. For example:

`sudo apt-get install python3`

### Downloading Dependancies
Alongside python, this project also uses a common library called pygame. Pygame is a library used to create games in python on any of the included operating systems. Since it does not require any other library in order to handle graphics rendering.

#### Pip
Pygame can be installed by using a package manager. The most commonly used one called `pip` is recommended in this case. If you downloaded python 3.4 or greated then pip is already on your system. If not follow [this](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) recommended guide. 

#### Pygame
Once pip is now installed on your system you can install pygame.
Run this following command to install pygame.

`pip install pygame`

## How to Play
The objective of the game is to get 4 chips in a row. This can be in any orientation. Either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
